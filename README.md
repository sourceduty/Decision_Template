[Decision Template](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-ynTJkhacQ-decision-template) is designed to assist users in crafting effective decision-making templates, focusing on structured, step-by-step approaches to evaluate and document choices. It guides users through identifying the type of decision—whether operational, strategic, tactical, or personal—and then helps structure decision criteria by defining objectives, identifying relevant factors such as cost or impact, and determining constraints. The GPT emphasizes assigning weights to criteria to prioritize importance, developing and evaluating alternatives systematically, and applying decision-making techniques like SWOT analysis or cost-benefit analysis to assess outcomes. It also facilitates stakeholder engagement by integrating their feedback and encourages documenting the process for transparency and accountability. A key feature is reviewing and learning from outcomes to refine future decision-making processes. The ultimate goal is to ensure decisions are well-informed, thoroughly analyzed, and aligned with overarching goals.
